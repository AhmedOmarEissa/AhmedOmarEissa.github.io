## Hello!

I am a senior data scientist at Uber, passionate about distilling insights from data using Python, SQL, and various other tools. I enjoy telling data stories and uncovering hidden patterns.

My journey in analytics began in 2016. Previously, I worked as a BI Engineer, building data pipelines and dashboards on top of HIVE/HADOOP. Before that, I served as an SAP BI consultant, creating reports and dashboards for SAP customers.

I have a keen interest in reading books about Data Science, Mathematics, Finance, and personal development. I often share my thoughts about the books I'm reading on my blog.

You can explore a portfolio of my analyses on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AhmedOmarEissa).
