Let me give you a quick intro about myself. I’ve started my career at Analytics in 2016 I’ve been working on a broad scope of data tasks aiming to empower the decisions of the business. I started my career with an internship in BI in SAP, followed by 1 year of consultancy job as a BI consultant. After that, I wanted to work with more data, so I joined Vodafone to work on Hadoop/Hive more. Then, I’ve realized that I want to be closer to the business to understand how the business makes use of data to inform decisions.

My current role is involving a very broad range of tasks, starting from data engineering to build easy-to-use data tables, followed by building centralized dashboards for hundreds of consumers and building centralized self-service tools to automate insight generation and reduce data requests. Being a partner with the business and a member of the Strategy & Planning team, I’m also helping to steer the business by addressing the pain-points and helping find the solution.

On personal level, I like reading specially in mathematics and logic, recently I started writing some blog posts to share data science knowledge in Arabic.
